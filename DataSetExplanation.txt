-in the first line there are (at least) 2 numbers: the first is the number of jobs and the second the number of machines (the 3rd is not necessary, it is the average number of machines per operation)

-Every row represents one job: the first number is the number of operations of that job, the second number (let's say k>=1) is the number of machines that can process the first operation; then according to k, there are k pairs of numbers (machine,processing time) that specify which are the machines and the processing times; then the data for the second operation and so on...

first row = 6 jobs and 6 machines 1 machine per operation
second row: job 1 has 6 operations, the first operation can be processed by 1 machine that is machine 3 with processing time 1.
